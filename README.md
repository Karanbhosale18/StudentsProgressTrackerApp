The Student Management Android Application is a comprehensive tool designed to improve the interaction between students and teachers, 
making academic tracking and communication more efficient. The app consists of two distinct portals: one for students and one for teachers.

1) Student Portal – Through the student portal, students can easily access their daily attendance records, track their academic progress, and
view any notices sent by their teachers. This ensures that students stay updated on their academic performance and are informed about important announcements.

2) Teacher Portal – The teacher portal allows teachers to input attendance, submit academic progress reports, and send notices or updates directly
to the student portal. Teachers can manage and monitor student data seamlessly, ensuring effective communication and management.

3) Both portals also feature a shared section where users can view essential application details such as the app’s development information,
about the app, and other relevant data. This ensures that both students and teachers have access to information about the app's purpose and functionality.

4) Firebase Database Integration – Firebase is used as the backend database for this app, allowing real-time synchronization of data between
the student and teacher portals. It ensures that all data, such as attendance records, progress reports, and notices, are securely stored and
updated instantly across both platforms. This integration makes the app more efficient, reliable, and scalable.
